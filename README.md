# Triton Digital® Player SDK

The Triton Digital® Player SDK allows you to create an HTML5 and chromeless media player connected to all Triton Digital® services (e.g. audio streaming, podcasting, audio advertising, etc.) via JavaScript®. Rendering is done in HTML5, so the media player is available on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

The Triton Digital® Player SDK does not provide a user interface (UI),  except for a video container used to display video advertisements and live video streams. The player UI interface and skinning have to be done in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript® by the developer. 

The Triton Digital® Player SDK is designed with a modular approach (AMD), where each module gives you access to a specific player feature.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

&ensp; [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

First, clone the GitHub project to your local development environment 

In your terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run dist
```

The files `td-sdk.min.js` and `td-sdk.min.js.map` will be created in the `dist` folder.

In your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open up an SDK Playground where you can test the SDK features.

## Running the tests

In your terminal, navigate to where you forked or cloned the SDK: 

```bash
npm run test
```

## Deployment
